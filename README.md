Yet another work in progress...

The goal is to have a GUI interface to do some Canvas stuff through the API.

-----------
ASSIGNMENT GENERATOR:

This is for creating multiple assignments with the same content (description, points possible, etc.) and turning it into sequentially named assignments (Assignment #1, Assignment #2, ...) that are due on various dates.

How to use the Assignment Generator:
1) Create an assignment as the template (in Canvas)
2) Find the assignment in the "Course Navigator" and save it.
3) Open the assignment generator and select the template.
4) Create the naming pattern.
5) Create the due dates
6) Select the target course
7) Select the target assignment group.
8) Click "Check Assignments."
9) Review the information.
10) Generate the assignments.
